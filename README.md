## Requirements/scope
* Minimal styling (i.e. only flex for responsive layout; no colour, typography, design).
* JavaScript logic that duplicates group of fields (passenger details).
* Cloned/duplicated elements should have a "Remove" button so that the cloned/duplicated elements can be deleted. (Passengers that are added should be removable, right?)
* Only first (lead) and second passenger fields are non-removable.
* No validation/processing required.
* Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML.
* Don't minify or compress any of the files.

## Resource(s)
* [Excelsheet that guides layout and required fields](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RMAztnEHqx0fZM2p7AIZFylvT4sM_vxf).
* [JSBin snippet that can guide the flex layout](https://jsbin.com/babenon/).

## Note(s)
* Responsiveness wasn't asked for but it should be a default approach that's applied whenever possible. Flex seems like the simpliest way to achieve this for this project.
